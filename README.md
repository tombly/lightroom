# Lightrooom Utils

This is a simple plugin for Adobe Lightroom Classic that lets you (1) set the title of all your photos to the name of the collection that they're within, and (2) output a CSV file with the metadata for each photo in your collection. You can find more details in the comments in the scripts (along with some options you'll likely need to customize for your collection).

# How to use

To install the plugin, just download the utils.lrplugin folder somewhere on your computer and use the File > Manage Plugins menu in Lightroom Classic to install it. After it's been installed, use the Library > Plugin Extras menu to run it.
